<h1>Creating 10 Routes using Express and EJS</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>
  Build 10 Routes and a view engine, say anything you want
</li>
  <li>
   Make 2 different templates, and use them both in different routes ( you can only have 1 view engine but multiple templates ) 
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Information on EJS</h2>
<p><h5>EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a popular templating language for JavaScript that allows you to generate dynamic HTML markup. 
  It provides a way to embed JavaScript code within your HTML templates, enabling you to generate dynamic content based on variables, perform conditionals,
  iterate over arrays, and more.</h5></p>

<p><h5>EJS templates are essentially HTML files with embedded JavaScript code. 
  The embedded JavaScript code is enclosed within <% %> tags, and the output of the JavaScript code can be inserted into the HTML markup using <%= %> tags.</h5></p>

  <h2>BONUS</h2>
  <p><h5>Dynamically add links to your view engine so you can make anchor tags to link your pages together, hmmm how would you do that ..... hint split, loop , you can figure it out, but it will take a lot of problem-solving, you'll have to do more than change one line of code, but it will only take a few lines of code, use an array or object another </h5></p>
